## 🔧 Real-World Problem Solved

### Problem
- People often lose track of daily expenses
- No proper record of where money is spent

### Solution
This application helps users:
- Track daily expenses
- Understand total spending
- Organize expenses by category (Food, Travel, Rent, etc.)

## ⚠️ Important Real-World Improvement (Category Issue)

### Initial Issue
- Categories were only added via Django Admin
- New users saw an empty category dropdown

### Fix Implemented
- Enabled users to create categories directly from the UI
- Categories are now user-specific

✅ This reflects **real-world problem solving**, not just textbook code.
